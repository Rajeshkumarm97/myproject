            <p><b>Finding The Best Eyewear Brands</b><br><br>
                     Whether required for vision, shade, or just as an aesthetic<br> there’s a lot that goes into finding that perfect pair of glasses. 
                
                The best eyewear brands on the market understand that<br>it’s about more than just the frames – lens quality,fit, and craftsmanship<br> all come together to create the dream pair of glasses for each person.
                
                While it’s easy enough to wander into a store to try things on until something clicks,<br> sometimes we like to know that there’s a brand available for quick online purchases as well.</p>

            <h3>The Best Sunglasses</h3>
            <p>The only "visible" quality test for sunglasses is their fit.<br> The lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little<br>"stray light" can reach the eye from their sides, or from above or below,<br> but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses. <br>To protect against "stray light" from the sides, the lenses should fit close<br>enough to the temples and/or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders.</p>
